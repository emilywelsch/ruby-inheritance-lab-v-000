Continue to operate on our student, steve. Have avi teach him some more important knowledge.
Create a new student and have that student learn a few things from avi as well.
Then, puts out the existing knowledge of each student.




some_knowledge = avi.teach

steve.learn(some_knowledge)
#jim.learn(some_knowledge)
steve.learn(some_knowledge)
steve.learn(some_knowledge)

puts "Steve just learned this important knowledge: '#{steve.knowledge.first}' from Avi"
